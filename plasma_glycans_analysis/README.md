# Randomisation and blocking the glycoprotein dataset from blood plasma
GP - glycoprotein
This script performs some EDA on the GP data from blood plasma. The dataset consits of mesurements from 31 plates, 
with additional variables as ethnics, age and gender and batch experiment number.
In order to exclude observation bias from such variables considering their distribution among the plates, the data was randomised and blocked
