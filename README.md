Glycomics data is characterised by big variation originated from both natural factors (as age, gender, ethnics and others) and different batch effects (sample replication, individual performance, experiment design etc.). Therefore, the choice of proper statistical tool for data preprocessing, (as randomisation and normalization) is essential for correct analysis and interpretation of the results.

This analysis is a part of the publication (Hae-Won Uh et. al 2020, DOI: 10.1039/C9MO00174C). There are three projects from this RSSSO2015 hackathon. 

The first project analyses the variance within the glycoproteins level measured from blood plasma and performs the randomisation and blocking technics.

The second project investigates normalization technics for proteins separated on the 2D gels.

The third project explores the sources of variation in stability of IgG and the level of glycoproteins (areas-20141202.csv).

Finally, the developed and tested normalisation functions are collected together in normalization_functions_23062015.R
