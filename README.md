# Glycomics Big Data analysis from RSSSO 2015. 

Glycomics data is characterised by big variation originated from both natural factors (as age, gender, ethnics and others) and different batch effects (sample replication, individual performance, experiment design etc.). Therefore, the choice of proper statistical tool for data preprocessing, (as randomisation and normalization) is essential for correct analysis and interpretation of the results.

There are three projects from this hackathon. The first project analyses the variance within the glycoproteins level measured from blood plasma and performs the randomisation and blocking technics.

The second project investigates the most sufficient normalization technic for proteins separated on the 2D gels.

The third project explores the sources of variation in stability of IgG () and the level of glycoproteins (areas-20141202.csv).

For each project, there are data included, scripts and corresponding papers with detailed experiment design. Finally, the developed and tested normalisation functions are collected together in normalization_functions_23062015.R
